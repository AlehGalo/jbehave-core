<h2>Story Reporters</h2>

<p>Reporting is an essential element of BDD as it allows to monitor
the outcome of the stories that have been run. At the heart of
JBehave's reporting is the <a
    href="javadoc/core/org/jbehave/core/reporters/StoryReporter.html">StoryReporter</a>,
which is used to report events as they occur.</p>

<p>Currently, the story reporters supported are:</p>
<ul>
    <li><a
        href="javadoc/core/org/jbehave/core/reporters/PrintStreamStoryReporter.html">PrintStreamStoryReporter</a>:
    generic reporter to a print stream, using formats that are
    configurable</li>
    <li><a
        href="javadoc/core/org/jbehave/core/reporters/HtmlPrintStreamStoryReporter.html">HtmlPrintStreamStoryReporter</a>:
    specialises the <b>PrintStreamStoryReporter</b> to use HTML
    formats</li>
    <li><a
        href="javadoc/core/org/jbehave/core/reporters/XmlPrintStreamStoryReporter.html">XmlPrintStreamStoryReporter</a>:
    specialises the <b>PrintStreamStoryReporter</b> to use XML
    formats</li>
    <li><a
        href="javadoc/core/org/jbehave/core/reporters/StatisticsStoryReporter.html">StatisticsStoryReporter</a>:
    collects statistics and stores them as properties</li>
    <li><a
        href="javadoc/core/org/jbehave/core/reporters/DelegatingStoryReporter.html">DelegatingStoryReporter</a>:
    delegates to any number of reporters as a proxy.</li>
</ul>

<p>Let's see an example of how we can configure the story
reporters. We use the <b>DelegatingStoryReporter</b> as a proxy for
the reporters we want to configure, in the example below a plain text
reporter (both to <b>System.out</b> and to a file) and an HTML reporter
to a file:</p>
<pre class="brush: java">
    private static StoryNameResolver resolver = new UnderscoredCamelCaseResolver(".story");

    public TraderStory(final Class storyClass) {
        super(new PropertyBasedConfiguration() {
            @Override
            public StoryDefiner forDefiningStorys() {
                return new ClasspathStoryDefiner(converter, new PatternStoryParser(this));
            }
        
            @Override
            public StoryReporter forReportingStorys() {
                return new StoryReporterBuilder(new FilePrintStreamFactory(resolver.resolve(storyClass)))
                            .with(CONSOLE) // report to System.out
                            .with(TXT)     // report to .txt file in PLAIN format
                            .with(HTML)    // report to .html file in HTML format
                            .with(XML)     // report to .xml file in XML format
                            .build();
            }

        }, new TraderSteps());
    }
</pre>

<p>Note that we use the <a
    href="javadoc/core/org/jbehave/core/reporters/StoryReporterBuilder.html">StoryReporterBuilder</a>
to implement a builder pattern for file-based reporters via the <a
    href="javadoc/core/org/jbehave/core/reporters/FilePrintStreamFactory.html">FilePrintStreamFactory</a>,
in which we inject the <a
    href="javadoc/core/org/jbehave/core/parser/StoryNameResolver.html">StoryNameResolver</a>
to derive the report file names from the story class, using the same
name resolution mechanism used for mapping Java classes and textual
storys. So, e.g., if the story class is <b>com.example.MyStory</b>,
we'll end up with file report outputs of the form: <b>com.example.my_story.[format]</b>
(where <b>format</b> is any of <b>txt,html,xml</b> in the example
above).</p>

<span class="followup">The file-based print stream factory for
the story reporting requires the story class to be provided in
order to derive from it the output file paths (with the appropriate
format extension). If you want to migrate multiple stories to using
file-based reporting, an intermediate stepping stone might be to provide
as a story class the parent class in which you build the story
reporter (TraderStory.class in the example), which will result in all
reporting (for a given format) to be appended to the same file. Then
gradually you can refactor your story classes to provide their class
to the parent (as the example shows). Otherwise, you may want to keep
output in a single file, the choice is yours. </span>

<p>The builder provides defaults for all the formats supported, but
if the user needs to create a bespoke instance of a reporter for a given
format, it can be easily done by overriding the default. E.g. to
override the reporter for <b>TXT</b> format to use a ".text" extension
(a possibly keywords for a different Locale):</p>
<pre class="brush: java">

        StoryReporter reporter = new StoryReporterBuilder(factory){
               public StoryReporter reporterFor(Format format){
                       switch (format) {
                           case TXT:
                               factory.useConfiguration(new FileConfiguration("text"));
                               return new PrintStreamStoryReporter(factory.getPrintStream(),
                                            new Properties(), new I18nKeyWords(Locale.ITALIAN), true);
                            default:
                               return super.reporterFor(format);
                       }
                   }
</pre>

<h2>Report Rendering</h2>

<p>The generation of the reports is only the first part of a
complete HTML-based reporting solution. Next we need to render the
reports, aggregating all the ones that have been configured and
generated in a given output directory, and presenting a collective index
view for all formats configured. Moreover, we need to style the view,
both for HTML and non-HTML report formats.</p>

<p>The rendering is the responsibility of the <a
    href="javadoc/core/org/jbehave/core/reporters/ReportRenderer.html">ReportRenderer</a>.
JBehave provides an implementation (<a
    href="javadoc/core/org/jbehave/core/reporters/FreemarkerReportRenderer.html">FreemarkerReportRenderer</a>)
based on <a href="http://freemarker.org">Freemarker</a> to allow a
templateable and easily styleable way to render the report views.</p>

<p>The default resources required for the report rendering are
bundled in the <b>jbehave-core.jar</b> (extract ftl/*.ftl, js/*.js and
style/*.css) but can be overridden. The FTL files need to be the
classpath for the <b>FreemarkerReportRenderer</b> to find them, while
the look and feel resources (js/*.js and style/*.css files) need to be
copied to the <b>target/jbehave-reports/rendered</b> directory (or
wherever the index page has been rendered to) Also note that the default
style makes use of images found in the <b>jbehave-site-resources.jar</b>.</p>

<p>Also, note that the report formats configured should match ones
found in the Ant or Maven execution for the report rendering task or
goal (c.f. <a href="running-stories.html">running stories</a> for
examples).</p>

<h2>Reporting Statistics</h2>

<p>The story statistics report above is treated in the rendering
slightly differently from other reports, in that the statistics are
displayed on the index page, if available. To ensure they are always
available the story reporter builder automatically builds with the <b>stats</b>
reporter included by default. To change or remove default formats simply
override the method:</p>
<pre class="brush: java">
        new StoryReporterBuilder(factory){
               protected void withDefaultFormats() {
                    with(Format.STATS);
               }
        }
</pre>

<p>By default, JBehave outputs file reports to the directory <b>jbehave-reports</b>
(relative to the story class code source location, e.g. the <b>target</b>
directory in Maven), but this can be changed via the builder:</p>

<pre class="brush: java">
        new StoryReporterBuilder(factory).outputTo("my-reports")
</pre>

<p>If the default formats or the output file directory are modified
via the builder, then correspondingly we need to inform the report
render of these changes. See <a href="running-stories.html">running
stories</a> for details on how to configure these changes.</p>

<h2>Next?</h2>

<span class="followup">The <a
    href="https://svn.codehaus.org/jbehave/trunk/core/examples/trader">trader
example</a> is configured to have a fully-working end-to-end use of JBehave
reporting (be sure to read the instructions on <a
    href="running-examples.html">running examples</a>). After running
the build simply open the page <b>target/jbehave-reports/rendered/index.html</b></span>
