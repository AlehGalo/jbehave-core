<h2>Running Stories</h2>

<p>JBehave was designed to be embeddable in different development
environments. The JBehave Core module contains support for running
storys as JUnit tests - which can be run either in your favourite IDE
or in your command-line build that supports JUnit tests. Other unit
testing frameworks, e.g. TestNG, can also be used very easily, c.f. <a
    href="faq.html">FAQ</a>.</p>

<p>You can also run storys using the JBehave Ant or Maven
extensions. Both support two way to lookup storys, by list of
story classes or by Java path includes/excludes pattern. Below are
examples on how to configure both extensions - using the trader example.</p>

<h2>Running as Ant task</h2>

<script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: xml"><![CDATA[
  <taskdef name="storyRunner"
    classname="org.jbehave.ant.StoryRunnerTask"
    classpathref="your.runtime.classpath" />
  
  <storyRunner 
    storyIncludes="**/stories/*.java"
    storyExcludes="**/*Steps.java" 
    classLoaderInjected="[true|false]"
    skip="[true|false]" 
    ignoreFailure="[true|false]"
    batch="[true|false]" 
    scope="[compile|test]"
    sourceDirectory="[sourceDirectory|src/main/java]"
    testSourceDirectory="[testSourceDirectory|src/test/java]" />
    
  <taskdef name="renderReports"
    classname="org.jbehave.ant.ReportRendererTask"
    classpathref="your.runtime.classpath" />
  
  <renderReports 
    outputDirectory="${basedir}/target/jbehave-reports" 
    formats="txt,html,xml" 
    templateProperties="defaultFormats=stats\nrenderedDirectory=rendered" />
    
]]></script>

<p>Remember to include <b>jbehave-ant</b> to your runtime classpath.</p>

<p>Note: we are using as default scope <b>compile</b>, which means
that the stories will be looked up in the source directory (which can
be optionally specified and defaults to <b>src/main/java</b>). If the
scope is set to <b>test</b> the stories will be looked up in the test
source directory (which can be optionally specified and defaults to <b>src/test/java</b>).

<h2>Running as Maven Plugin</h2>

            </goals>
          </execution>
        </executions>
    </plugin>
]]></script>

<p>Note: we are using as default scope <b>compile</b>, which means
that the stories will be looked up in the POM source directory. If the
scope is set to <b>test</b> the stories will be looked up in the POM
test source directory.</p>

<h2>Instantiating RunnableStory classes</h2>

<p>Both Ant and Maven by default instantiate the RunnableStory class via
a public constructor with a single ClassLoader parameter (i.e. with
property <b>classLoaderInjected</b> set to <b>true</b>). This allows the
story to be injected with the class loader during instantiation, e.g.
as used in the loading of I18n resource bundles. If the user does not
require the class loader during instantiation, its injection can be
disabled by setting the property <b>classLoaderInjected</b> to <b>false</b>.
In this case only the default public constructor is required.</p>

<h2>Running Stories for reports</h2>

<p>By default, the story runners are configured to <b>fail-fast</b>,
i.e. the execution will stop at first failure (but will complete
execution of the all the stories in the story or textual story
file). To allow the generation of complete reports view, the runners
need to be enabled to execute story in <b>batch</b> and <b>ignoreFailure</b>
modes (i.e. setting these flags to <b>true</b>). In this way all
stories will run and the build will be nominally successful but a full
report can ben generated, including the failed and pending steps. Note
that the batch mode is strictly speaking not essential but makes it
easier to get a summary of the failed stories.</p>
