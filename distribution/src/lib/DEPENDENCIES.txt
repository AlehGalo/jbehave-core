JBehave dependencies are defined in the jbehave-distribution POM.

Choose the desired version from:

http://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.jbehave/jbehave-distribution/

If you use Maven or Ivy or Grape, you can define dependencies declaratively, 
using groupId and artifactId detailed in the POM (see also docs/download.html).

If you use Ant, download the POM with the desired version, rename it to pom.xml,
and execute Ant target in build.xml provided:

$ ant copy-dependencies
