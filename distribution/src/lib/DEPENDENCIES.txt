JBehave dependencies are defined in the POM.

If you use Maven or Ivy or Grape, you can define dependencies declaratively, 
using groupId and artifactId detailed in the POM (see also docs/download.html).

If you use Ant, you can download and copy the dependencies by using the build.xml provided:

$ ant copy-dependencies

Note: Requires maven-ant-tasks-2.1.jar in $ANT_HOME/lib
      Download it from http://maven.apache.org/ant-tasks/download.html
