<h2>Reusing Textual Stories</h2>

<p>BDD encourages the description of the acceptance tests in a
manner that is intelligible and transparent to the business users. This
in particular may mean setting up explicitly via scenario steps all the
pre-requirements of a particular scenario. For complex scenarios this
will rapidly lead to maintainance problems due to duplication of entire
blocks of steps.</p>

<p>To help the user better manager more complex scenarios, JBehave
allow the specification of entire stories as a pre-requisite for
another scenario.</p>

<pre class="brush: bdd">
    Scenario:  A scenario in which the user can run other stories as pre-requisites
    
    GivenStories: path/to/story1,path/to/story2,...path/to/storyN
    
    Given ... // normal scenario steps
</pre>
<p>When JBehave encounters the keyword <b>GivenStories</b>, it
will run the (one or more) textual stories specified by path in the
list (using the same Steps instances specified for the parent story)
before proceeding to the execution of the normal scenario steps.</p>

<p>Another way to avoid duplication of textual scenario steps is to
use the natural ordering of execution of the story classes.
Typically, this means that the stories will be executed in the
alphabetical order of their names and a convention can be adopted to
have stories start with an alpha-numberical prefix, such as 'Snn' where
'nn' is an incremental number. This though has the disadvantage of having
to run all stories leading up to the desired scenario, which in some
cases can be unnecessary and time consuming. For example, for debugging
purposes one may need to one run one scenario, which may have a
dependency on just one other story. This is where <b>GivenStories</b> is
most useful.</p>
