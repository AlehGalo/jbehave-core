<h2>Locating Stories</h2>

<p>In JBehave, stories can be located locally, i.e. in class path, or externally, locatable via URLs.
    Depending on where the stories are located, an appropriate <a
            href="javadoc/core/org/jbehave/core/io/StoryLoader.html">StoryLoader</a> needs to be defined:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        <a href="javadoc/core/org/jbehave/core/io/LoadFromClasspath.html">LoadFromClasspath</a> for
        stories located in classpath.
    </li>
        <li>
        <a href="javadoc/core/org/jbehave/core/io/LoadFromURL.html">LoadFromURL</a> for
        stories located via URL.
    </li>
</ul>

<span>By default, JBehave expects stories to be written in plain text, but also supports other formats as long as these
can be converted to a textual which is then parsed by the  <a
            href="javadoc/core/org/jbehave/core/parsers/StoryParser.html">StoryParser</a>.</span>

<p>More details and examples can be found in <a href="configuration.html">Configuration</a> page.
