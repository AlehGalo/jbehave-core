<h2>FAQs</h2>

<h3>What is BDD?</h3>

<p>BDD stands for <b>Behaviour-Driven Development</b> and you can
learn more about BBD from our <a href="more-on-bdd.html">More on BDD</a>
page.</p>

<h3>What Java version is required by JBehave?</h3>

<p>JBehave requires a JDK 1.5 or greater.</p>

<h3>How do I use JBehave within my development environment?</h3>

<p>Stories can be run in IDEs, as <a href="http://junit.org">JUnit</a>
tests.</p>

<p>Stories can also be run on command line, see <a
    href="running-stories.html">running stories</a>. It can also be
run via web runner, although the web support is not part of JBehave
Core. For more info on web support refer to <a
    href="http://jbehave.org/reference/web/stable">JBehave Web</a>.</p>

<h3>What libraries does JBehave depend on?</h3>

<p>Check the <a href="dependencies.html">dependencies</a> details.</p>

<h3>Eclipse can't seem to find annotations if they are contained
within a jar</h3>

<p>Some versions of Eclipse need to be aware of the JBehave source
to enable the JUnit plugin for stories, as they can’t spot the <b>@Test</b>
annotation in a class jar. The link to the core sources is available
from the <a href="download.html">download</a> page.</p>

<p>Alternatively, <a href="http://m2eclipse.sonatype.org">M2Eclipse</a>
users can downlaod the sources automatically.</p>

<p>A workaround is to override the runStory() method annotated
with @Test</p>

<pre class="brush: java">
public class YourStory extends JUnitStory {

    @Test
    public void run() throws Throwable {
        super.run();
    }

}
</pre>
<p>Note that this is only required for the root class of all your
stories.</p>

<h3>Can I run my story in IDE with TestNG?</h3>

<p>Similarly to the proposed workaround above, you should be able to
run with TestNG by simply annotating the runStory() method in your
root Story class with the TestNG @Test annotation.</p>

<pre class="brush: java">
public class YourStory extends JUnitStory {

    @org.testng.annotations.Test 
    public void run() throws Throwable {
        super.run();
    }

}
</pre>

<p>Note that as we don't tend to use TestNG this solution has not
been well-tested. If you encounter any issues please let us know.</p>

<h3>How do I make my scenarios fail when steps are not matched and
are shown as pending?</h3>

<p>Configure the <a
    href="javadoc/core/org/jbehave/core/errors/PendingErrorStrategy.html">PendingErrorStrategy</a>
in <a href="javadoc/core/org/jbehave/core/configuration/StoryConfiguration.html">StoryConfiguration</a></p>
<pre class="brush: java">
   StoryConfiguration storyConfiguration = new MostUsefulStoryConfiguration();
   storyConfiguration.usePendingErrorStrategy(PendingErrorStrategy.FAILING);  
</pre>

<h3>How do I output my story steps just when a story fails?</h3>

<p>Configure the <a
    href="javadoc/core/org/jbehave/core/reporters/StoryReporter.html">StoryReporter</a>
in <a href="javadoc/core/org/jbehave/core/configuration/StoryConfiguration.html">StoryConfiguration</a></p>

<pre class="brush: java">
   StoryConfiguration storyConfiguration = new MostUsefulStoryConfiguration();
   storyConfiguration.useStoryReporter(new SilentSuccessFilter(ConsoleOutput()));

</pre>

<p>Alternatively, you can use <a
    href="javadoc/core/org/jbehave/core/PropertyBasedConfiguration.html">PropertyBasedConfiguration</a>
setting system property <b>"org.jbehave.outputall"</b>.</p>

<h3>Can my steps classes be POJOs?</h3>

<p>Yes, one can write steps as POJOs and then create an instance of
<a href="javadoc/core/org/jbehave/steps/CandidateSteps.html">CandidateSteps</a>
via the <a href="javadoc/core/org/jbehave/steps/StepsFactory.html">StepsFactory</a>
</p>
<pre class="brush: java">
    StepsConfiguration configuration = ... // optional configuration
    new StepsFactory(configuration).createCandidateSteps(new TraderSteps()));    
</pre>

<p>Alternatively, one can extend the <a
    href="javadoc/core/org/jbehave/steps/Steps.html">Steps</a> class.</p>

<h3>Can I insert comments in the textual scenarios?</h3>

<p>Yes, one can add them the scenario title, which allows free text up the first keyword of the scenario, e.g. the first Given.</p>

<p>From version 2.4.1, one can also insert ignorable steps between executable steps, using keyword "!--" (which can be changed via I18n properties)</p> 
<pre class="brush: bdd">
Scenario: This is a description of the scenario, of the intended behaviour and its verification

Given a precondition
!-- This is an ignorable step, used to insert a comment,
which can be multiline, just like any other step!
When something happens
Then outcome is verified 
</pre>
