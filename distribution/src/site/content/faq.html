<h2>FAQs</h2>

<h3>What is BDD?</h3>

<p>BDD stands for <b>Behaviour-Driven Development</b> and you can
learn more about BBD from our <a href="more-on-bdd.html">More on BDD</a>
page.</p>

<h3>What Java version is required by JBehave?</h3>

<p>JBehave requires a JDK 1.5 or greater.</p>

<h3>How do I use JBehave within my development environment?</h3>

<p>Stories can be run in IDEs, as <a href="http://junit.org">JUnit</a>
tests.</p>

<p>Stories can also be run on command line, see <a
	href="running-stories.html">running stories</a>. It can also be run via
web runner, although the web support is not part of JBehave Core. For
more info on web support refer to <a
	href="http://jbehave.org/reference/web/stable">JBehave Web</a>.</p>

<h3>What libraries does JBehave depend on?</h3>

<p>Check the <a href="dependencies.html">dependencies</a> details.</p>

<h3>IDE can't seem to recognise the JUnitStory as a JUnit test</h3>

<p>Some IDEs need to be aware of the JBehave source
to enable the JUnit plugin for stories, as they can't spot the <b>@Test</b>
annotation in a class jar. The link to the core sources is available
from the <a href="download.html">download</a> page.</p>

<p>Alternatively, <a href="http://m2eclipse.sonatype.org">M2Eclipse</a>
users can downlaod the sources automatically.</p>

<p>A simple workaround is to override the JUnitStory run() method
annotated with @Test</p>

<pre class="brush: java">
public class YourStory extends JUnitStory {

    @Test
    public void run() throws Throwable {
        super.run();
    }

}
</pre>
<p>Note that this is only required for the root class of all your
stories.</p>

<h3>Which testing frameworks does JBehave support?</h3>

<p>JBehave comes bundled with out-the-box JUnit support but has no
tie-in to JUnit. You can easily configure JBehave stories to run with
other testing framework, such as TestNG or Spring's Test module (see <a
	href="developing-stories.html">developing stories</a> for more
details).</p>

<p>A quick workaround to run with TestNG is simply to annotate the run()
method in your root JUnitStory class with the TestNG @Test annotation:</p>

<pre class="brush: java">
public class YourStory extends JUnitStory {

    @org.testng.annotations.Test 
    public void run() throws Throwable {
        super.run();
    }

}
</pre>

<p>Note that as we don't tend to use TestNG this solution has not
been well-tested. If you encounter any issues please let us know.</p>

<h3>How do I make my scenarios fail when steps are not matched and
are shown as pending?</h3>

<p>Configure the <a
	href="javadoc/core/org/jbehave/core/failures/PendingStepStrategy.html">PendingStepStrategy</a>:
in <a
	href="javadoc/core/org/jbehave/core/configuration/Configuration.html">Configuration</a></p>
<pre class="brush: java">
   new MostUsefulConfiguration().usePendingStepStrategy(new FailingPendingStepStrategy());  
</pre>

<h3>How do I output my story steps just when a story fails?</h3>

<p>Configure the <a
	href="javadoc/core/org/jbehave/core/reporters/StoryReporter.html">StoryReporter</a>
in <a
	href="javadoc/core/org/jbehave/core/configuration/Configuration.html">Configuration</a></p>

<pre class="brush: java">
   new MostUsefulConfiguration().useStoryReporter(new SilentSuccessFilter(ConsoleOutput()));
</pre>

<p>Alternatively, you can use <a
	href="javadoc/core/org/jbehave/core/PropertyBasedConfiguration.html">PropertyBasedConfiguration</a>
setting system property <b>"org.jbehave.outputall"</b>.</p>

<h3>Can my steps classes be POJOs?</h3>

<p>Yes, one can write steps as POJOs and then create an instance of
<a href="javadoc/core/org/jbehave/steps/CandidateSteps.html">CandidateSteps</a>
via the <a href="javadoc/core/org/jbehave/steps/StepsFactory.html">StepsFactory</a>
</p>
<pre class="brush: java">
    Configuration configuration = ... // optional configuration
    new InstanceStepsFactory(configuration, new TraderSteps()).createCandidateSteps());    
</pre>

<p>Alternatively, one can extend the <a
	href="javadoc/core/org/jbehave/steps/Steps.html">Steps</a> class.</p>

<h3>Can I insert comments in the textual scenarios?</h3>

<p>Yes, one can add them the scenario title, which allows free text
up the first keyword of the scenario, e.g. the first Given.</p>

<p>From version 2.4.1, one can also insert ignorable steps between
executable steps, using keyword "!--" (which can be changed via I18n
properties)</p>
<pre class="brush: bdd">
Scenario: This is a description of the scenario, of the intended behaviour and its verification

Given a precondition
!-- This is an ignorable step, used to insert a comment,
which can be multiline, just like any other step!
When something happens
Then outcome is verified
