<h2>Story Reporters</h2>

<p>Reporting is an essential element of BDD as it allows to monitor
the outcome of the stories that have been run. At the heart of JBehave's
reporting is the <a
	href="javadoc/core/org/jbehave/core/reporters/StoryReporter.html">StoryReporter</a>,
to which events are reported as they occur.</p>

<p>Currently, the story reporters supported are:</p>
<ul>
	<li><a
		href="javadoc/core/org/jbehave/core/reporters/ConsoleOutput.html">ConsoleOutput</a>:
	a text-based console output</li>
	<li><a
		href="javadoc/core/org/jbehave/core/reporters/IdeOnlyConsoleOutput.html">IdeOnlyConsoleOutput</a>:
	a text-based console output, which only reports events when running in
	IDEs (Eclipse and IDEA supported).</li>
	<li><a
		href="javadoc/core/org/jbehave/core/reporters/TxtOutput.html">TxtOutput</a>:
	a text-based file output</li>
	<li><a
		href="javadoc/core/org/jbehave/core/reporters/HtmlOutput.html">HtmlOutput</a>:
	an HTML file output</li>
	<li><a
		href="javadoc/core/org/jbehave/core/reporters/XmlOutput.html">XmlOutput</a>:
	an XML file output</li>
	<li><a
		href="javadoc/core/org/jbehave/core/reporters/PostStoryStatisticsCollector.html">PostStoryStatisticsCollector</a>:
	collects statistics and stores them as properties after story is run</li>
	<li><a
		href="javadoc/core/org/jbehave/core/reporters/DelegatingStoryReporter.html">DelegatingStoryReporter</a>:
	delegates to any number of reporters as a proxy.</li>
</ul>

<p>The <a
	href="javadoc/core/org/jbehave/core/reporters/StoryReporterBuilder.html">StoryReporterBuilder</a>
allows to configure multiple story reporters with pre-configured
formats: CONSOLE, TXT, HTML and XML.</p>

<span class="followup">For a fully-working example of reporting
configuration you may consult the <a href="running-examples.html">examples</a>.
Note that the configuration only needs to be done in one place, i.e. the
parent story class, and not repeated in every story class that maps to a
textual story. </span>

<p>Note that we use the <a
	href="javadoc/core/org/jbehave/core/reporters/StoryReporterBuilder.html">StoryReporterBuilder</a>
to implement a builder pattern for file-based reporters via the <a
	href="javadoc/core/org/jbehave/core/reporters/FilePrintStreamFactory.html">FilePrintStreamFactory</a>.
The file path resolution strategy from a story path to a report file
path is definable via the <a
	href="javadoc/core/org/jbehave/core/reporters/FilePrintStreamFactory.FilePathResolver.html">FilePathResolver</a>.
By default, it uses the <a
	href="javadoc/core/org/jbehave/core/reporters/FilePrintStreamFactory.ResolveToPackagedName.html">ResolveToPackagedName</a>
whereby the story path is resolved to a Java package. So, e.g., if the
story path is <b>com/example/my_cool.story</b>, we'll end up with file
report outputs of the form: <b>com.example.my_cool.[format]</b> (where <b>format</b>
is any of <b>txt,html,xml</b> in the example above). An alternative
strategy, is the <a
	href="javadoc/core/org/jbehave/core/reporters/FilePrintStreamFactory.ResolveToSimpleName.html">ResolveToSimpleName</a>,
whereby only the simple name portion, without the package structure, is
considered, i.e. we'd end up with file report outputs of the form: <b>my_cool.[format]</b></p>

<span class="followup">The file-based print stream factory for
the story reporting requires the story class to be provided in order to
derive from it the output file paths (with the appropriate format
extension). If you want to migrate multiple stories to using file-based
reporting, an intermediate stepping stone might be to provide as a story
class the parent class in which you build the story reporter
(TraderStory.class in the example), which will result in all reporting
(for a given format) to be appended to the same file. Then gradually you
can refactor your story classes to provide their class to the parent (as
the example shows). Otherwise, you may want to keep output in a single
file, the choice is yours. </span>

<p>The builder provides defaults for all the formats supported, but
if the user needs to create a bespoke instance of a reporter for a given
format, it can be easily done by overriding the default. E.g. to
override the reporter for <b>TXT</b> format to use a ".text" extension:</p>
<pre class="brush: java">
        StoryReporterBuilder builder = new StoryReporterBuilder() {
            public StoryReporter reporterFor(String storyPath, Format format) {
                switch (format) {
                case TXT:
                    factory.useConfiguration(new FileConfiguration("text"));
                    return new TxtOutput(factory.createPrintStream(), new Properties(), 
                                                        new LocalizedKeywords(), true);                    
                default:
                    return super.reporterFor(storyPath, format);
                }
            }
        };
</pre>

<h2>View Generation</h2>

<p>The generation of the reports is only the first part of a
complete HTML-based reporting solution. Next we generate the stories
view, aggregating all the reports that have been configured and written
to a given output directory, and presenting a collective index view for
all formats configured. Moreover, we can style the reports, both for
HTML and non-HTML report formats, by decorating their content with CSS
and syntax highlighting. The decorating of non-HTML reports can be
switched off if one prefers the raw content accessible via a URL:</p>

<pre class="brush: java">
    Properties viewResources = new Properties();
	viewResources("decorateNonHtml","false");
    new StoryReporterBuilder().useViewResources(viewResources);        
</pre>

<p>The view generation is the responsibility of the <a
	href="javadoc/core/org/jbehave/core/reporters/ViewGenerator.html">ViewGenerator</a>.
JBehave provides an implementation (<a
	href="javadoc/core/org/jbehave/core/reporters/FreemarkerViewGenerator.html">FreemarkerViewGenerator.</a>)
based on <a href="http://freemarker.org">Freemarker</a> to allow a
templateable and easily styleable way to generate the view.</p>

<p>The default resources required for the view generation are
bundled in the <b>jbehave-core-resources.zip</b> but can be overridden.
The Freemarker templates (the ftl/** files) need to be the classpath for
the <b>FreemarkerViewGenerator</b> to find them, while the look and feel
resources (the js/* and style/* files) need to be copied to the <b>target/jbehave-reports/view</b>
directory (or wherever the index view is generated to) Also note that
the default style makes use of images found in the <b>jbehave-site-resources.zip</b>.</p>

<h2>Reporting Statistics</h2>

<p>The story statistics report above is treated in the view
generation slightly differently from other reports, in that the
statistics are displayed on the index view page, if available. To ensure
they are always available the story reporter builder is configured to
have <b>stats</b> as a default format (although the default formats need
to be added to the builder).</p>

<h2>Default Formats</h2>

<p>Default formats allow users to define a builder that can be used
in multiple configurations without having to repeat tediously all the
formats required, if these are used consistently. By default, "stats" is
the only default format (used for collecting reporting statistics). To
modify simply override the method <b>withDefaultFormats()</b>. E.g. to
add "txt" as a default format:</p>
<pre class="brush: java">
        new StoryReporterBuilder(){
               public StoryReporterBuilder withDefaultFormats() {
                    return withFormats(STATS, TXT);
               }
        }
</pre>

<p>By default, JBehave writes file-based reports to the relative
directory <b>jbehave-reports</b> (relative to the story class code
source location, e.g. the <b>target</b> directory in Maven), but this
can be changed via the builder:</p>

<pre class="brush: java">
        new StoryReporterBuilder().withRelativeDirectory("my-reports")
</pre>

<p>In some cases, we may want to set the code location explicitly
from a file path:</p>

<pre class="brush: java">
    new StoryReporterBuilder().withCodeLocation(CodeLocations.codeLocationFromPath("build/classes"))
</pre>

<p>If the default formats or the output file directory are modified
via the builder, then correspondingly we need to inform the view
generator if these changes. See <a href="running-stories.html">running
stories</a> for details on how to configure these changes.</p>

<h2>Next?</h2>

<span class="followup">The trader examples are configured to have
a fully-working end-to-end use of JBehave reporting (be sure to read the
instructions on <a href="running-examples.html">running examples</a>).
After running the build simply open the page <b>target/jbehave-reports/view/index.html</b>
of the appropriate trader example modules.</span>
