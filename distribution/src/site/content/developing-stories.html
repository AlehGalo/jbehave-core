<h2>Writing Textual Stories</h2>

<p><a href="concepts.html">Behaviour-Driven Development</a>
encourages you to start defining the stories via scenarios that express the desired
behaviour in a textual format, e.g.:</p>
<pre class="brush: bdd">
    Given a stock of symbol STK1 and a threshold of 10.0
    When the stock is traded at 5.0
    Then the alert status should be OFF
</pre>
<p>The textual scenario should use the language of the business
domain and shield away as much as possible the details of the technical
implementation. Also, it should be given a name that is expressive of
the functionality that is being verified, i.e. <b>trader_is_alerted_of_status.story</b>.
</p>
<p>The scenario should use a syntax compatible with the <a
    href="grammar.html">Grammar</a>.</p>


<span class="followup">A story is a collection of scenarios, each
detailing different examples of the behaviour of
    a given increment of functionality of the system.</span>

<pre class="brush: bdd">
    Scenario:  trader is not alerted below threshold

    Given a stock of symbol STK1 and a threshold of 10.0
    When the stock is traded at 5.0
    Then the alert status should be OFF

    Scenario:  trader is alerted above threshold

    Given a stock of symbol STK1 and a threshold of 10.0
    When the stock is traded at 11.0
    Then the alert status should be ON
</pre>

<h2>Mapping Textual Scenario Steps to Java Methods via annotations</h2>

<p>JBehave maps textual steps to Java methods via <a
    href="javadoc/core/org/jbehave/core/steps/CandidateSteps.html">CandidateSteps</a>.
The scenario writer need only provide annotated methods that match, by
regex patterns, the textual steps. One way this can be done is by
extending the default implementation <a
    href="javadoc/core/org/jbehave/core/steps/Steps.html">Steps</a>:
</p>
<pre class="brush: java">
public class TraderSteps extends Steps {

    private Stock stock;

    @Given("a stock of symbol $symbol and a threshold of $threshold")
    public void aStock(String symbol, double threshold) {
        stock = new Stock(symbol, threshold);
    }

    @When("the stock is traded at $price")
    public void theStockIsTradedAt(double price) {
        stock.tradeAt(price);
    }

    @Then("the alert status should be $status")
    public void theAlertStatusShouldBe(String status) {
        ensureThat(stock.getStatus().name(), equalTo(status));
    }

}
</pre>
<p>Equivalently, as composition is often preferrable to inheritance,
the scenario writer can use a POJO (i.e. without extending Steps)</p>
<pre class="brush: java">
public class TraderSteps { // look, Ma, I'm a POJO!!
 
    private Stock stock;

    @Given("a stock of symbol $symbol and a threshold of $threshold")
    public void aStock(String symbol, double threshold) {
        stock = new Stock(symbol, threshold);
    }

    @When("the stock is traded at $price")
    public void theStockIsTradedAt(double price) {
        stock.tradeAt(price);
    }

    @Then("the alert status should be $status")
    public void theAlertStatusShouldBe(String status) {
        ensureThat(stock.getStatus().name(), equalTo(status));
    }

}
</pre>
<p>If POJOs are used we need to create <a
    href="javadoc/core/org/jbehave/core/steps/CandidateSteps.html">CandidateSteps</a>
via the <a
    href="javadoc/core/org/jbehave/core/steps/StepsFactory.html">StepsFactory</a>
</p>
<pre class="brush: java">
    StepsConfiguration configuration = ... // optional configuration
    new StepsFactory(configuration).createCandidateSteps(new TraderSteps()));    
</pre>
<p>Each step is annotated with one of the <a href="annotations.html">step
annotations</a>, each holding a regex pattern as value. The pattern is used
to match the method in the Steps class with the appropriate parameters.
The simplest default behaviour identifies arguments in the candidate
step by the words prefixed by the <b>$</b> character. More advanced <a
    href="parameter-injection.html">parameter injection</a> mechanisms
are also supported by JBehave.</p>
<p>JBehave execute all the matched steps in the order in which they
are found in the Scenario. It is up to the implementor of the Steps
class to provide the logic to tie together the results of the execution
of each step. This can be done by keeping state member variables in the
Steps class or possibly by using a service API or other dependency.</p>

<h2>Mapping Story Files to Java Classes</h2>

<p>In JBehave stories can be run in an automated way via a
mapping to Java classes, either a one-to-one mapping or a many-to-one mapping.</p>
<p>
In the case of one-to-one mapping, the textual
story path is resolved from a Java class via the <a
    href="javadoc/core/org/jbehave/core/io/StoryPathResolver.html">StoryPathResolver</a>.
In our example, we need to create a file <code>TraderIsAletedOfStatus.java</code>,
which maps to out textual story in same package, and it would extend a base Story class
that contains the configuration:</p>

<p>Thus in our case the example Story would look like:</p>
<pre class="brush: java">
public class TraderStory extends JUnitStory {

    public TraderStory() {
        Configuration configuration = new MostUsefulConfiguration();
        configuration.useStoryPathResolver(new UnderscoredCamelCaseResolver(".story"));
        configuration.useStoryLoader(new LoadFromClasspath(this.getClass().getClassLoader()));

        addSteps(new TraderSteps()); // if TraderSteps extends Steps
        addSteps(new StepsFactory().createCandidateSteps(new TraderSteps())); // if TraderSteps is a POJO
    }
}
</pre>

<p>
In the case of many-to-one mapping, the textual
story path must be explicitly provided when extending  <a
    href="javadoc/core/org/jbehave/core/JUnitStories.html">JUnitStories</a>:
</p>

<script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: java"><![CDATA[
public class TraderStories extends JUnitStories {

	private URLTraderEmbedder embedder = new URLTraderEmbedder();

	@Override
	protected Embedder configuredEmbedder() {
		return embedder;
	}

	@Override
	protected List<String> storyPaths() {
		return embedder.storyPaths();
	}
}
]]></script>

<p>Here we are configuring our textual story files to end with
extension <b>.story</b>, by overriding the default behaviour of <a
    href="javadoc/core/org/jbehave/core/io/UnderscoredCamelCaseResolver.html">UnderscoredCamelCaseResolver</a>
which has no extension.</p>
