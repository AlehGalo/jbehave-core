<h2>Providing meta information</h2>

<p>BDD encourages as much information as is meaningful to the
business to be included in the stories and scenarios. But as these
stories and scenarios grow it may become difficult to navigate through
all this information. It will also become necessary to organise the
growing number of stories by different criterias.</p>

<p>To help users better manage their stories, JBehave allow the
specification of meta information, both at story and scenario level.</p>

<pre class="brush: bdd">
    Meta:
    @author Mauro
    @theme UI

    Scenario:  A scenario in which the user can view all relevant information via UI    
    Meta:
    @ignore false    
    Given ... // normal scenario steps

    Scenario:  A scenario which we cannot run every time due to some technical contraint
    Meta:
    @ignore true    
    Given ... // normal scenario steps

</pre>

<p>When JBehave encounters the keyword <b>Meta:</b>, it collects the
following pairs of properties, where the property name is prefixed by <b>@</b>.
The meta property names are not constrained by JBehave, so the user can
chose whatever names are appropriate. JBehave simply collects them as
part of the story and scenario and makes them available for arbitrary
purposes, e.g. filtering in the running of the stories.</p>
