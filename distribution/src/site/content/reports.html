<h2>Story Reporters</h2>

<p>Reporting is an essential element of BDD as it allows to monitor
the outcome of the stories that have been run. At the heart of
JBehave's reporting is the <a
    href="javadoc/core/org/jbehave/core/reporters/StoryReporter.html">StoryReporter</a>,
which is used to report events as they occur.</p>

<p>Currently, the story reporters supported are:</p>
<ul>
    <li><a
        href="javadoc/core/org/jbehave/core/reporters/PrintStreamOutput.html">PrintStreamOutput</a>:
    generic reporter to a print stream, using formats that are configurable</li>
    <li><a
        href="javadoc/core/org/jbehave/core/reporters/ConsoleOutput.html">ConsoleOutput</a>:
    specialises the <b>PrintStreamOutput</b> to use TXT console output</li>
    <li><a
        href="javadoc/core/org/jbehave/core/reporters/TxtOutput.html">TxtOutput</a>:
    specialises the <b>PrintStreamOutput</b> to use TXT file output</li>
    <li><a
        href="javadoc/core/org/jbehave/core/reporters/HtmlOutput.html">HtmlOutput</a>:
    specialises the <b>PrintStreamOutput</b> to use HTML file output</li>
    <li><a
        href="javadoc/core/org/jbehave/core/reporters/XmlOutput.html">XmlOutput</a>:
    specialises the <b>PrintStreamOutput</b> to use XML file output</li>
    <li><a
        href="javadoc/core/org/jbehave/core/reporters/PostStoryStatisticsCollector.html">PostStoryStatisticsCollector</a>:
    collects statistics and stores them as properties after story is run</li>
    <li><a
        href="javadoc/core/org/jbehave/core/reporters/DelegatingStoryReporter.html">DelegatingStoryReporter</a>:
    delegates to any number of reporters as a proxy.</li>
</ul>

<p>Let's see an example of how we can configure the story
reporters. We use the <b>DelegatingStoryReporter</b> as a proxy for
the reporters we want to configure, in the example below a plain text
reporter (both to <b>System.out</b> and to a file) and an HTML reporter
to a file:</p>
<pre class="brush: java">

    public TraderStory() {
        // start with default story configuration, overriding story definer and reporter
        StoryConfiguration storyConfiguration = new MostUsefulStoryConfiguration();
        storyConfiguration.useStoryPathResolver(new UnderscoredCamelCaseResolver(".story"));
        String storyPath = storyConfiguration.storyPathResolver().resolve(this.getClass());
        storyConfiguration.useStoryLoader(new LoadFromClasspath(this.getClass().getClassLoader()));
        storyConfiguration.useStoryReporter(new StoryReporterBuilder(new FilePrintStreamFactory(storyPath))
                .outputTo("target/jbehave-reports").outputAsAbsolute(true) // only required with Ant (cf note below)
                .withDefaultFormats() // add default formats 
                .withFormats(CONSOLE, TXT, HTML, XML)
                .build(storyPath));
        useConfiguration(storyConfiguration);

        // start with default steps configuration
        StepsConfiguration stepsConfiguration = new MostUsefulStepsConfiguration();
        addSteps(createSteps(stepsConfiguration));
    }

    protected CandidateSteps[] createSteps(StepsConfiguration configuration) {
        return new StepsFactory(configuration).createCandidateSteps(new TraderSteps(new TradingService()), new BeforeAfterSteps());
    }

</pre>

<span class="followup">For a fully-working example of reporting configuration you may consult the 
<a href="http://git.codehaus.org/gitweb.cgi?p=jbehave-git.git;a=tree;f=examples/trader">trader example</a>.  Note that the configuration only needs
 to be done in one place, i.e. the parent Scenario class, and not repeated in every Scenario class that maps to a 
 textual scenario.
</span>

<span class="followup">In general, the specification of the output directory is optional.  It is necessary when running with Ant as 
a workaround for Ant's classloading strategy which uses the Ant Project.class ProtectionDomain, which in turn leads to 
the <b>$ANT_HOME/lib</b> as the code source location.  A better solution would be to override the hacky AntClassLoader behaviour, as
also noted by Ant folks in the <a href="http://www.docjar.com/docs/api/org/apache/tools/ant/AntClassLoader.html#defineClassFromData%28File,%20byte,%20String%29">AntClassLoader#defineClassFromData</a>
method.  A user-friendly way to do is being investigated.
</span>

<p>Note that we use the <a
    href="javadoc/core/org/jbehave/core/reporters/StoryReporterBuilder.html">StoryReporterBuilder</a>
to implement a builder pattern for file-based reporters via the <a
    href="javadoc/core/org/jbehave/core/reporters/FilePrintStreamFactory.html">FilePrintStreamFactory</a>,
in which we inject the <a
    href="javadoc/core/org/jbehave/core/io/StoryPathResolver.html">StoryPathResolver</a>
to derive the report file names from the story class, using the same
name resolution mechanism used for mapping Java classes and textual
stories. So, e.g., if the story class is <b>com.example.MyStory</b>,
we'll end up with file report outputs of the form: <b>com.example.my_story.[format]</b>
(where <b>format</b> is any of <b>txt,html,xml</b> in the example
above).</p>

<span class="followup">The file-based print stream factory for
the story reporting requires the story class to be provided in
order to derive from it the output file paths (with the appropriate
format extension). If you want to migrate multiple stories to using
file-based reporting, an intermediate stepping stone might be to provide
as a story class the parent class in which you build the story
reporter (TraderStory.class in the example), which will result in all
reporting (for a given format) to be appended to the same file. Then
gradually you can refactor your story classes to provide their class
to the parent (as the example shows). Otherwise, you may want to keep
output in a single file, the choice is yours. </span>

<p>The builder provides defaults for all the formats supported, but
if the user needs to create a bespoke instance of a reporter for a given
format, it can be easily done by overriding the default. E.g. to
override the reporter for <b>TXT</b> format to use a ".text" extension
(a possibly keywords for a different Locale):</p>
<pre class="brush: java">

        StoryReporter reporter = new StoryReporterBuilder(){
               public StoryReporter reporterFor(String storyPath, Format format){
			           FilePrintStreamFactory factory = new FilePrintStreamFactory(new StoryLocation(storyPath, ouputLocationClass));
                       switch (format) {
                           case TXT:
                               factory.useConfiguration(new FileConfiguration("text"));
                               return new PrintStreamOutput(factory.getPrintStream(),
                                            new Properties(), new LocalizedKeywords(Locale.ITALIAN), true);
                            default:
                               return super.reporterFor(format);
                       }
                   }
</pre>

<h2>Report Rendering</h2>

<p>The generation of the reports is only the first part of a
complete HTML-based reporting solution. Next we render the
reports, aggregating all the ones that have been configured and
generated in a given output directory, and presenting a collective index
view for all formats configured. Moreover, we can style the reports,
both for HTML and non-HTML report formats, by decorating their content
with CSS and syntax highlighting.  The decorating of non-HTML reports can
be switched off if one prefers the raw content accessible via a URL:</p>

<pre class="brush: java">
		Properties properties = new Properties();
		properties.setProperty("decorateNonHtml","false");
        new StoryReporterBuilder().useRenderingResources(properties);        
</pre>

<p>The rendering is the responsibility of the <a
    href="javadoc/core/org/jbehave/core/reporters/ReportRenderer.html">ReportRenderer</a>.
JBehave provides an implementation (<a
    href="javadoc/core/org/jbehave/core/reporters/FreemarkerReportRenderer.html">FreemarkerReportRenderer</a>)
based on <a href="http://freemarker.org">Freemarker</a> to allow a
templateable and easily styleable way to render the report views.</p>

<p>The default resources required for the report rendering are
bundled in the <b>jbehave-core.jar</b> (extract ftl/*.ftl, js/*.js and
style/*.css) but can be overridden. The FTL files need to be the
classpath for the <b>FreemarkerReportRenderer</b> to find them, while
the look and feel resources (js/*.js and style/*.css files) need to be
copied to the <b>target/jbehave-reports/rendered</b> directory (or
wherever the index page has been rendered to) Also note that the default
style makes use of images found in the <b>jbehave-site-resources.jar</b>.</p>

<p>Also, note that the report formats configured should match ones
found in the Ant or Maven execution for the report rendering task or
goal (c.f. <a href="running-stories.html">running stories</a> for
examples).</p>

<h2>Reporting Statistics</h2>

<p>The story statistics report above is treated in the rendering
slightly differently from other reports, in that the statistics are
displayed on the index page, if available. To ensure they are always
available the story reporter builder is configured to have <b>stats</b>
as a default format (although the default formats need to be added to
the builder). 
</p>

<h2>Default Formats</h2>

<p>Default formats allow users to define a builder that can be
used in multiple configurations without having to repeat tediously all the 
formats required, if these are used consistently.  By default, "stats" is 
the only default format (used for collecting reporting statistics).  To modify
simply override the method <b>withDefaultFormats()</b>.  E.g. to add "txt" as a
default format:</p>
<pre class="brush: java">
        new StoryReporterBuilder(){
               public StoryReporterBuilder withDefaultFormats() {
                    return withFormats(STATS, TXT);
               }
        }
</pre>

<p>By default, JBehave outputs file reports to the directory <b>jbehave-reports</b>
(relative to the story class code source location, e.g. the <b>target</b>
directory in Maven), but this can be changed via the builder:</p>

<pre class="brush: java">
        new StoryReporterBuilder().outputTo("my-reports")
</pre>

<p>In some cases, i.e. when using with Ant, the class code source location may not be 
properly set, or different from what is expected.  In this case, one can tell the builder 
to treat the output directory as an absolute path:</p>

<pre class="brush: java">
        new StoryReporterBuilder().outputTo("target/my-reports").outputAsAbsolute(true)
</pre>

<p>If the default formats or the output file directory are modified
via the builder, then correspondingly we need to inform the report
render of these changes. See <a href="running-stories.html">running
stories</a> for details on how to configure these changes.</p>

<h2>Next?</h2>

<span class="followup">The <a
    href="https://svn.codehaus.org/jbehave/trunk/core/examples/trader">trader
example</a> is configured to have a fully-working end-to-end use of JBehave
reporting (be sure to read the instructions on <a
    href="running-examples.html">running examples</a>). After running
the build simply open the page <b>target/jbehave-reports/rendered/index.html</b></span>
