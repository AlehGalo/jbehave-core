<h2>Prioriting Steps</h2>

<p>The matching of candidate steps to textual steps is central to JBehave's design. 
The first candidate step that matches is used to create an executable step.  In some case, though,
one can have cases in which multiple candidate steps can match the same textual step, e.g. when
the steps are very similar.</p>

<p>In these cases, JBehave allows to specify a specific <a
    href="javadoc/core/org/jbehave/core/steps/PrioritisingStrategy.html">PrioritisingStrategy</a>
in the <a
    href="javadoc/core/org/jbehave/core/steps/StepFinder.html">StepFinder</a>.  The default 
    strategy is <a
    href="javadoc/core/org/jbehave/core/steps/StepFinder.ByPriorityField.html">ByPriorityField</a>
    which prioritises the steps by the priority field explicitly set in the Given/When/Then annotations.</p>
<pre class="brush: java">
   PrioritisingStrategy strategy = new ByPriorityField();
   StepFinder stepFinder = new StepFinder(strategy);
