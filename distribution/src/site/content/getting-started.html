<h2>Getting Started</h2>

<h3>Write a textual story</h3>

<p>Create a textual story file with a name that expresses the
behaviour to verify, e.g. <b>i_can_toggle_a_cell.story</b> and define steps in
it:</p>
<pre class="brush: bdd">
      Given a 5 by 5 game
      When I toggle the cell at (2, 3)
      Then the grid should look like
      .....
      .....
      .....
      ..X..
      .....
      When I toggle the cell at (2, 4)
      Then the grid should look like
      .....
      .....
      .....
      ..X..
      ..X..
      When I toggle the cell at (2, 3)
      Then the grid should look like
      .....
      .....
      .....
      .....
      ..X..
</pre>
<p>Steps must start with one of the keywords highlighted (see <a
    href="concepts.html">Concepts</a> for more details) and are not
limited to a single line.  Also, unless otherwise indicated, a story
has at least one implicit scenario, each of which is a collection of
steps.</p>

<h3>Map scenario steps to Java methods</h3>

<p>Define your <a
    href="javadoc/core/org/jbehave/core/steps/Steps.html">Steps</a>
class, e.g. call it <b>GridSteps</b>, which will contain the Java
methods that are mapped to the textual steps. The methods need to
annotated with one of the JBehave <a
    href="javadoc/core/org/jbehave/core/annotations/package-summary.html">annotations</a>
and the annotated value should contain a regex pattern that matches the
textual step:</p>

<pre class="brush: java">
      public class GridSteps {

        private Game game;
        private StringRenderer renderer;

        @Given("a $width by $height game")
        public void theGameIsRunning(int width, int height) {
            game = new Game(width, height);
            renderer = new StringRenderer();
            game.setObserver(renderer);
        }

        @When("I toggle the cell at ($column, $row)")
        public void iToggleTheCellAt(int column, int row) {
            game.toggleCellAt(column, row);
        }

        @Then("the grid should look like $grid")
        public void theGridShouldLookLike(String grid) {
            Ensure.ensureThat(renderer.asString(), CoreMatchers.equalTo(grid));
        }

      }
</pre>

<h3>Map story to Java class</h3>

<p>Define your <a
    href="javadoc/core/org/jbehave/core/RunnableStory.html">RunnableStory</a>
class with a name that can be mapped to the textual story filename,
e.g. <b>ICanToggleACell.java</b>:</p>

<pre class="brush: java">
      public class ICanToggleACell extends JUnitStory {

        public ICanToggleACell() {
            addSteps(new InstanceStepsFactory(new GridSteps()).createCandidateSteps()); // varargs, can have lots of steps
        }
      }
</pre>
<p>The story is now configured to use the <b>GridSteps</b> that
hold the step mappings.</p>

<h3>Run story in IDE</h3>

<p>Open your favourite IDE, the <b>ICanToggleACell.java</b> class
will allow itself to run as a JUnit test. Be sure to check that you have
all the required <a href="dependencies.html">dependencies</a> in your
classpath.</p>

<h2>Next?</h2>

<span class="followup">JBehave development has been
example-driven and it is very instructive to go through one or more working
examples in the source repository, which illustrate features. Be
sure to read about <a href="running-examples.html">running examples</a>.
The examples also show command-line ways of <a
