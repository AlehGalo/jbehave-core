Build system: 

JDK required: 1.5+
Maven (http://maven.apache.org) required: 2.2.1+

Encoding: 

Configure IDE to use UTF-8 for all files
Configure Maven by adding "-Dfile.encoding=UTF-8" to $MAVEN_OPTS 
 
IDE integration:

Maven is supported in Intellij IDEA out-of-the-box 
Maven is supported in Eclipse via m2eclipse plugin (http://m2eclipse.sonatype.org/)

Maven Build profiles:  

- default: builds all releasable modules
- reporting: builds reports
- distribution: builds distribution
- examples: builds all headless examples
- gui: builds examples that require gui (i.e. non-headless) mode (separated as they do not run on CI: http://builds.codehaus.org/browse/JBEHAVE)
- nt: no-test, builds skipping unit-test behaviours 

Note:  profiles are additive and the default profile is always active.
E.g.: 

- build core and all examples 

mvn install -Pexamples,gui

- build with reporting and distribution:

mvn install -Preporting,distribution 

Building a release with Maven:

- mvn release:prepare -Preporting,distribution
- mvn release:perform -Preporting,distribution

Settings configuration:

The build requires the profile "glassfish" contained in settings.xml to be active.  
Users can either add the profile to their own ~/.m2/settings.xml (ensuring it is active) or can build with -s settings.xml option:

- mvn -s settings.xml <goal>
