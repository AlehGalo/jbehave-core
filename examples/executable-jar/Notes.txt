A simple example project showing how to put jbehave, your code and the
stories inside a executable/runnable jar.

The package target creates a jar file containing all classes from
jbehave and its dependecies that can be run with

jar -jar jbehave-executable-jar-example-<VERSION>-jar-with-dependencies.jar,
this way the tests do not have any dependencies except java itself.

Currently there is no way to search for stories inside the classpath,
which means that you have to list the story files explicitly in the
storyPaths method, either by creating a list directly or reading a
file.

When building the project with Maven, the story paths in the example
are correct, when using the Export as Runnable Jar option in Eclipse,
the paths change from e.g org/jbehave/path to resources/org/jbehave/path
so the paths in the code have to changed accordingly when you want to
use Eclipse export.
